# Cora Node Classification Challenge (GCN-Based)

## 📌 Overview

This repository hosts the **Cora Node Classification Challenge**, a graph machine learning competition based on the **Cora citation network**. Participants are required to design and train **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** models to classify scientific papers into research topics using node features and graph structure.

## 🧠 Task Description

* Each node represents a **scientific publication**.
* Edges represent **citation relationships** between papers.
* Each node belongs to **one of 7 classes**.

### Objective

Train a model that accurately predicts the class labels of **unlabeled test nodes**, using:

* Node features
* Graph connectivity

## 📊 Dataset Details

⚠️ Note on Dataset Difficulty

To increase the difficulty level and encourage robust model design, controlled noise has been added to the dataset.

The provided dataset is NOT identical to the original Cora benchmark

Participants must work with the provided files

Replacing the data with the original Cora dataset is not allowed

## 📊 Dataset Details

The dataset is derived from the **Cora citation network**.

| Property      | Value                |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Nodes         | 2,708                |
| Edges         | 5,429 (undirected)   |
| Node features | 1,433 (bag-of-words) |
| Classes       | 7                    |

### Data Splits (Standard Cora Protocol)
